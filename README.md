A part of Alpha-Zero-Neural-Network. It was one of the game implemented for my 3rd Year Durham University Dissertation Project, where I trained a neural network to best me at a game of Othello. This achieved a mark of 77%. See Alpha-Zero-Neural-Network for more details, https://github.com/brainbow30/Alpha-Zero-Neural-Network
